bugfixes:
  - generated URLs had now way to set the scheme for use reverse proxies or load balancers (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/issues/27).
  - the ``href`` field in responses did not properly use the server name or the new support schemes (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/pull/29).
