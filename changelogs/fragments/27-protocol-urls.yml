bugfixes:
  - generated URLs had now way to set the scheme for use reverse proxies or load balancers (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/issues/27).
  - the ``href`` field in responses did not use the new support for schemes (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/pull/29).
  - the bare ``collections/`` endpoint was not using authorization and would have failed if authentication was required to read from Artifactory (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/pull/29).
  - the ``/api/`` endpoint did not define a route that didn't end in ``/``, which caused Flask to issue a redirect, however the redirect does not use the preferred scheme (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/pull/29).
