  0.3.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - connections - retries are now done automatically both on proxied upstream
        requests and on requests to Artifactory (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/pull/7,
        https://github.com/briantist/galactory/pull/8).
      - performance - optimizations when iterating collections allow a huge reduction
        in the number of requests to artifactory needed (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/pull/9).
      release_summary: Some big reliability and performance enhancements included
        in ths release.
    fragments:
    - 0.3.0.yml
    - 9-performance-and-retries.yml
    release_date: '2022-08-08'
  0.3.1:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - container releases - change meaning of container tags, add ARM64 container
        releases (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/pull/10, https://github.com/briantist/galactory/pull/11).
      release_summary: 'ARM64 containers are now part of the release process. The
        meaning of the ``latest`` tag for containers now refers to the build from
        the latest *git tag* rather than the latest commit.

        Containers are now also tagged with the branch name to correspond to the latest
        commit in a specific branch, for example ``ghcr.io/briantist/galactory:main``.

        There are no functional changes in this release.'

  0.4.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - configuration - all options can now be configured via environment variables,
        direct in CLI, or in config files (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/pull/12).
      release_summary: This release adds much improved configuration support.
    fragments:
    - 0.4.0.yml
    - 12-config.yml
    release_date: '2022-09-02'
  0.5.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - proxy cache - finer control over when and what gets cached when proxying upstream,
        allowing for proxy configurations with less permission in artifactory (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/issues/4,
        https://github.com/briantist/galactory/pull/13).
      release_summary: This release contains cache control options. This enables more
        scenarios for proxying, such as proxying with no Artifactory API key, or one
        without write permission. The cache expiry time can now be configured, and
        it can be set independently in different galactory instances pointed at the
        same cache in artifactory.
    fragments:
    - 0.5.0.yml
    - 13-cache-control.yml
    release_date: '2022-09-04'
  0.6.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - manifest loading - galactory no longer uses Artifactory's "Archive Entry Download"
        endpoint, removing one piece of code that requires a pro license or greater
        (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/issues/5, https://github.com/briantist/galactory/pull/16).
      - publish endpoint - add ``PUBLISH_SKIP_CONFIGURED_KEY`` option which disallows
        using a configured API key on the ``publish`` endpoint (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/issues/14).
      release_summary: With this release we've added the ability to block the use
        of a configured API key with the publish endpoint, preventing clients from
        publishing anonymously.
    fragments:
    - 0.6.0.yml
    - 14-publish-skip-configured-key.yml
    - 5-manifest-destiny.yml
    release_date: '2022-10-08'
  0.7.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - property setting - by default properties are now set on the initial upload
        of a collection to Artifactory. This removes an additional roundtrip to the
        server, and removes another API call that requires a Pro license of Artifactory.
        However, some reverse proxy configurations will not work with this. A new
        parameter ``USE_PROPERTY_FALLBACK`` has been added which will use the old
        behavior of setting properties in a second request,  but this will still require
        a Pro license to use. This option may be removed in a future version. See
        (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/issues/19).
      release_summary: Property setting is now done at upload time, which removes
        another piece of Pro license code, but may cause issues with certain reverse
        proxy configurations. A new fallback option is introduced to use the old behavior,
        but it may be removed in a future version.

    - 0.7.0.yml
