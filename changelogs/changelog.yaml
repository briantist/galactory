      - connections - retries are now done automatically both on proxied upstream
        requests and on requests to Artifactory (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/pull/7,
        https://github.com/briantist/galactory/pull/8).
      - performance - optimizations when iterating collections allow a huge reduction
        in the number of requests to artifactory needed (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/pull/9).
      release_summary: Some big reliability and performance enhancements included
        in ths release.

  0.3.1:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - container releases - change meaning of container tags, add ARM64 container
        releases (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/pull/10, https://github.com/briantist/galactory/pull/11).
      release_summary: 'ARM64 containers are now part of the release process. The
        meaning of the ``latest`` tag for containers now refers to the build from
        the latest *git tag* rather than the latest commit.

        Containers are now also tagged with the branch name to correspond to the latest
        commit in a specific branch, for example ``ghcr.io/briantist/galactory:main``.

        There are no functional changes in this release.'

  0.5.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - proxy cache - finer control over when and what gets cached when proxying upstream,
        allowing for proxy configurations with less permission in artifactory (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/issues/4,
        https://github.com/briantist/galactory/pull/13).
      release_summary: This release contains cache control options. This enables more
        scenarios for proxying, such as proxying with no Artifactory API key, or one
        without write permission. The cache expiry time can now be configured, and
        it can be set independently in different galactory instances pointed at the
        same cache in artifactory.

    - 0.5.0.yml
