release_summary: |-
  With this release we've hopefully gotten rid of the last code that requires a paid Artifactory license, so galactory should now be fully usable with Artifactory OSS. We've also added the ability to block the use of a configured API key with the publish endpoint, preventing clients from publishing anonymously.
