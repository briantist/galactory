breaking_changes:
  - property setting - by default properties are now set on the initial upload of a collection to Artifactory. This removes an additional roundtrip to the server, and removes another API call that requires a Pro license of Artifactory. However, some reverse proxy configurations will not work with this. A new parameter ``USE_PROPERTY_FALLBACK`` has been added which will use the old behavior of setting properties in a second request,  but this will still require a Pro license to use. This option may be removed in a future version. See (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/issues/19).
