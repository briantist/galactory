bugfixes:
  - A collection that had only prereleases would cause a 500 error when visiting certain endpoints due to a lack of a ``latest_version`` key. The latest version is now the latest stable (non-prerelease) version if any exist, which is the same behavior as before, but if only prereleases exist, then ``latest_version`` will refer to the latest prerelease (https://github.com/briantist/galactory/issues/87).
