# Adopters

This is an alphabetical list of known [Galactory](https://github.com/briantist/galactory) adopters:

* [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/about) - DigitalOcean simplifies cloud computing so builders can spend more time creating software that changes the world. Internally, we use lots of Ansible and it has been great being able to consume both internal and external collections with [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/). This takes the load off of public Galaxy, and, it allows us to curate collections.
